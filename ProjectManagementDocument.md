##1. Vision
**1.1 Vision**

In a world with ever growing connectivity, why do we fail to connect with those who are not only the closest to us, but also share pursuits and interest with us? This problem is highlighted every year when a challenging test or exam is upon us. You realize you have 20+ other people in the same class, but yet you have no medium to connect. There seems to be a void when trying to attempt a task that's of upmost importance - sharing knowledge and providing intellectual growth with classmates. Moodle provides a method for professors to pass their information to students, if they choose, but aside from this sparingly used  one-to-many medium the transfer of information amongst a class is exceedingly difficult. This semester I've received numerous emails from students in the same class as me saying they don't have any partners for a group. This exclaims the desire and need for a system that eases the ability to connect students. 
	The goal of SchoolBook was to create and provide this system. To create an environment where students can: provide and receive an information they need regarding the classes they're currently taking, express struggles and have discussions on the solutions, easily connect and find students when studying or planning to study, expand their network, find tutors for available classes, reward academic success by allowing students to earn money as tutors.

##2. Configuration Management Plan
**2.1 GitHub**

GitHub was used to store our project so all team members could easily reach and update the project. Once a team member pushed an update to GitHub, they would let everyone know in GroupMe.

##3. Process Model
**3.1 Phased Development**

Phased development was used so that subsystems could be divided amongst all team members. We chose to develop iteratively to allow us to test the app as a whole earlier than if we had developed incrementally. This meant that once a subsystem was functional, we could test that subsystem together with the entire app.

##5. Potential Risks
**5.1 Human Risk**

A team member dropping the course late in the semester could pose a risk due to the lack of contribution to the project.

**5.2 Time Risk**

Time risk consist of the team members not submitting their portions of the project by the due date/time.

**5.3 Resource Risk**

Resource risk was a factor due to the fact that some team members did not have a PC to access the code and database. The risk was resolved by remoting into a server setup by Clayton.

**5.4 Liability Issues**

The team was libale for ensuring that tutors met up in a safe place (on campus study spots) rather than an unfamiliar area.

##6. Team Organization

**6.1 Team Style**

We chose to have a egoless group structure for the Schoolbook project. We chose this style because it would foster more ideas for the project.

**6.2 Team Members and Roles**

| Team Member	| Roles			| Reasons for Meeting Absense	|
